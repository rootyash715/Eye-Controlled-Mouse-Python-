Troubleshooting & Tips

Improve lighting and face the camera for more reliable tracking.

If cursor jumps around, reduce SMOOTHING or increase recent_centers buffer size.

If clicks are too sensitive, increase the cooldowns or tune EAR thresholds.

If MediaPipe does not return refined iris landmarks, ensure refine_landmarks=True in the FaceMesh constructor and use a clear frontal face.
