How it works (short)

MediaPipe Face Mesh provides facial landmarks including iris points.

Compute iris center, normalize to the webcam frame and map to screen coordinates.

Smooth movement with exponential smoothing and issue pyautogui.moveTo.

Estimate eye openness using a simple vertical/horizontal landmark distance ratio (EAR-like metric). When one eye is closed and the other open (a wink), trigger left/right click respecting cooldowns.
